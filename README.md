`brine-fp` is a 192-bit fixed-point math library built for high-precision, deterministic computation in constrained environments like the Solana SVM. It provides arithmetic, exponentiation, logarithms, and powers using `u192`-based representations, and is optimized for low compute unit (CU) usage on-chain.

## ⚡ Performance

| Operation    | CU (Approx.) |
|--------------|--------------|
| `log(2)`     |     ~18,500  |
| `exp(0.5)`   |     ~15,000  |
| `pow(2, ½)`  |        ~100  |
| `frexp(2)`   |        ~150  |

These values are measured inside the Solana SVM (via test programs).

## Features

- 192-bit unsigned & signed fixed-point types with 18 decimal places.
- Supports `log`, `exp`, `pow`, `floor`, `ceil`, `almost_eq`, etc.
- Remez polynomial approximations based on FreeBSD `msun`.
- Designed for deterministic and overflow-aware computation.
- Suitable for smart contract environments and financial logic.

## Quick Start

```rust
use brine_fp::UnsignedNumeric;

// Construct a fixed-point number: 5.0
let five = UnsignedNumeric::new(5);

// Compute its exponential
let result = five.signed().exp().unwrap();

println!("e^5 ≈ {}", result.to_string());
```

---

## Internal Representation

Each `UnsignedNumeric` wraps a `InnerUint([lo, mid, hi])`, representing a 192-bit unsigned integer:

```rust
InnerUint([lo, mid, hi])

// Equivalent to:
// value = lo + (mid << 64) + (hi << 128)
```

All values are scaled by `10^18`, enabling 18-digit decimal precision. 

This format ensures:

- Extreme range: from `1e-18` up to `~6.3 × 10³⁹` real-world units
- High precision: 18 decimals
- Fully deterministic integer math (no `f64`, no `float`)

---

## Use Cases

- On-chain bonding curves
- DeFi math & simulations
- Deterministic pricing formulas
- Token economics
- Time-value calculations
- Anywhere you want `exp()` or `log()` without `f64`
